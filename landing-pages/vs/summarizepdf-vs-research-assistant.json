      "answer": "Research assistants cost $18,000-36,000/year. AI costs $228/year for unlimited usage - save $17,772-35,772 annually (99% cost reduction). Even part-time assistants cost $500-1,500/month vs AI's $19/month."

    {
      "question": "Is AI summarization as good as a human assistant's?",
      "answer": "For initial screening and summarization, AI is often better - it's faster, more consistent, and never gets fatigued. Human assistants are better for complex analysis, critical evaluation, and tasks requiring domain expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I still need a research assistant?",
      "answer": "Use both! Let AI handle document processing and summarization (saving 80% of assistant time), then use your assistant for high-value tasks like in-depth analysis, experimental work, and critical thinking. Better results at lower cost."
