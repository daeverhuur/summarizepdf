    {
      "question": "Can AI summarization replace reading papers?",

      "question": "How much time does AI summarization really save?",
      "answer": "For a 20-page paper: AI takes 2-3 minutes vs 45-60 minutes manual reading (90% time savings). For 50 papers: 2-3 hours with AI vs 37-50 hours manual (92% time savings)."

    {
      "question": "Is AI summarization accurate enough for research?",

      "question": "When should I still read papers manually?",
      "answer": "Read manually when: papers are directly relevant to your research, you're evaluating methodology, you need to critique the work, or you're building on specific findings. Use AI for initial screening and background research."
